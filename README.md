# Twitter Sentiment Analysis for Airline Services

In this project, part of the "Introduction to Natural Language Processing" course, we focus on analyzing Twitter data to gauge customer sentiment about different airline services. Our primary goal is to identify the sentiment expressed in a tweet, which can serve as a proxy for understanding customer satisfaction and public perception of airlines.

## Overview

Social media, particularly Twitter, is a goldmine for consumer feedback and opinions. Airlines often find themselves the subject of discussion, whether for exemplary service or less-than-ideal customer experiences. This project leverages Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to sift through tweets and assess sentiments toward various airline services.

### Objectives

- **Data Collection**: Gather tweets mentioning various airlines.
- **Preprocessing**: Clean and preprocess the text data to prepare it for analysis.
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Implement NLP techniques to identify whether the sentiments in the tweets are positive, negative, or neutral.
- **Insight Generation**: Analyze the results to derive meaningful insights about customer satisfaction and public perception.
